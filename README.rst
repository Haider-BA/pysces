bempy: a Boundary Element Method for Python
===========================================

This package implements a boundary element method for solving for the fluid flow
around streamlined bodies moving in a potential flow.  The goal is to provide a
clean interface so that different methods may be easily swapped out, while being
computationally efficient.
